    "\n",
    "1. **Easy to Learn and Read**\n",
    "   - Clean, readable syntax that resembles natural language\n",
    "   - Uses indentation for code blocks instead of brackets\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Versatile Applications**\n",
    "   - Web Development (Django, Flask)\n",
    "   - Data Science & Machine Learning (NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch)\n",
    "   - Automation & Scripting\n",
    "   - Scientific Computing\n",
    "   - Desktop Applications\n",
    "   - Game Development\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. Indentation\n",

    "Comments are notes in your code that Python ignores. They help explain what your code does.\n",

    "- **Single-line comments**: Start with `#`\n",
    "- **Multi-line comments**: Use triple quotes `'''` or `\"\"\"`"

    "\n",
    "1. **Dependency Isolation**: Different projects may require different versions of the same library (e.g., Project A needs Django 3.2, but Project B needs Django 4.0). Virtual environments allow you to keep these dependencies separate.\n",
    "2. **Clean System Environment**: It prevents cluttering your global Python installation with packages that are only needed for a specific project.\n",
    "3. **Reproducibility**: It makes it easier for other developers to recreate your environment and run your code with the exact same package versions.\n",
